currently underway with you. However I was previously sent this from
my time at Skyman Industries, and as such still consider it worth responding

present, we also consider the implications on patients and accessibility at the

color:black'>1) The current definition of ‘cannabis-based ingredient’ requires
that the ingredient is both extracted from cannabis and is intended to be used
in, or for, a dosage product. Would you agree with expanding the definition to
include ingredients such as milled cannabis to help broaden the variety of
dosage products available to patients in New Zealand?<br>
</span></i><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;

color:black'>We are always interested in ways that patient accessibility can be
improved, however without knowing more about the original intentions behind not
including that (was it an oversight?) we would abstain from providing a
perspective on this.<br>
<br>
<i>2) The requirement for ‘starting material for export’ to meet a minimum
quality standard was put in place to establish New Zealand as a high-quality
producer of starting material but can be a barrier to export. Would you agree
with removing the requirement for each consignment of starting material for
export to meet the minimum quality standard?</i><br>
Yes, we wholeheartedly agree that this should be removed. This should have
never been the case from the outset, especially given other countries couldn't
care less about our regulations by the time it arrives on their shores.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:
normal'><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;
color:black'>This needlessly creates barriers to exporting, as well as
double-handling of certifications of product, not to mention we can only
imagine this being a pointless burden on the Medicinal Cannabis Agency.<br>
<br>
<i>3) A medicinal cannabis product that has been verified as meeting the
minimum quality standard must meet the <span class=SpellE>labelling</span>
requirements set out under regulation 19 of the Misuse of Drugs (Medicinal
Cannabis) Regulations 2019. However, sometimes importing countries have
different <span class=SpellE>labelling</span> requirements for these products,
including specifying the language required.&nbsp; Would you agree with
exempting verified medicinal cannabis products for export from needing to meet
the requirements of regulation 19?<br>
</i>Yes, we agree. As per above, other countries that are importing products
from us don't specifically care about how &quot;we&quot; feel it should be <span
class=SpellE>labelled</span>, and this only adds to the cost / delays in
exporting products. This should be exempted also.<br>
<br>
<i>4) Currently, all cannabis-based ingredients and medicinal cannabis products
are required to meet the minimum quality standard before they are imported into
New Zealand unless they are specifically exempted.&nbsp; This applies even when
samples are being imported for analytical testing and where the research to be
conducted is considered to be therapeutic in nature, but the products will not
be directly administered to a person.&nbsp; Would you agree with removing the
requirement to meet the minimum quality standard for these small samples?&nbsp;
And if so, do you believe that 200ml in the case of a liquid or 200g in the
case of solid material would be an appropriate upper limit?</i><br>
Yes, removing the upper limit seems very sensible.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='margin-bottom:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;line-height:

mso-fareast-font-family:"Times New Roman";mso-bidi-font-family:Arial;
color:black'>If the 200ml / 200g limit is all that's available, sure. Given
this will not impact us, please take our input with a grain of salt, however we
would even suggest that potentially those amounts do not go far enough. Instead
we would suggest perhaps 500mL &amp; 454g (1lb) may be more beneficial in terms
of removing the need to &quot;double handle&quot; and import multiple amounts
for testing.<br>
<br>
<i>5) A number of tests are currently required for both extracted
cannabis-based ingredients and dosage products.&nbsp; As manufacturers are
required to manufacture in accordance with Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP)
and are therefore already required to control for contamination and impurities,
would you agree with removing the following testing requirements from the
minimum quality standard for extracted cannabis-based ingredients if this is
controlled in the dosage product<span class=GramE>:</span><br>
- microbiological contamination<br>
- heavy metals<br>
- pesticides<br>
- absence of <span class=SpellE>aflatoxins</span><br>
- <span class=SpellE>ochratoxin</span> A<br>
- residual solvents?<br>
Please note that if in response to the feedback received on question 1 a
proposal is put forward to include milled cannabis as a cannabis-based
ingredient, then the applicability of this proposed change for milled cannabis
will be considered.</i><br>
Although this will not directly impact us in cultivation, this makes sense,
given those shouldn't be present regardless. Even if there were trace amounts
previously present, those should also be removed through the extraction process
(depending on the extraction method residual solvents may remain), and as such
we support this.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<i>6) Under the Regulations, testing to demonstrate compliance with the minimum
quality standard must be performed by a GMP-certified manufacturer or laboratory.
However, no GMP-certified testing laboratory in New Zealand can currently
perform all the tests required by the minimum quality standard, and there is no
indication of when or if such a laboratory will be established. Would you agree
with allowing the following lower-risk tests for assessment against the minimum
quality standard to be undertaken at ISO/IEC 17025:2017 accredited laboratories<span
class=GramE>:</span><br>
- microbial contamination<br>
- heavy metals<br>

color:black'>Although this will not directly impact us in cultivation, we
agree, and would even go so far as to suggest that all testing should be able to
be undertaken by an accredited to ISO/IEC17025 laboratory. We find it amusing
that the standards have been made so strict there isn't a company that can test
for them all, nor is there any indication of one being able to some 3-odd years
after the Medicinal Cannabis Scheme implementation. As such, we take that as a
strong indication that the regulations absolutely must be relaxed.<br>
<br>
<i>7) Dosage products may only include an <span class=SpellE>excipient</span>
for which there is a monograph in the European Pharmacopoeia. What is your opinion
on allowing the use of <span class=SpellE>excipients</span> with monographs
from the British Pharmacopoeia and/or United States Pharmacopoeia in dosage
products?</i><br>
Although this will not directly impact us in cultivation, we agree, this should
be changed. Further compliance options will reduce the financial obligations /
burdens on vendors and will be a net win for patients and the industry as a
whole.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
<i>8) Do you consider that the current tests, test methods and associated
limits specified in the minimum quality standards are the most appropriate? If
not, what alternative tests, test methods and associated testing limits would
you like to see incorporated into the minimum quality standard? If you would
like to see certain tests included, please specify which pharmacopoeia (including
version) you are referring to.<br>
</i>No, we do not believe the current associated limits are appropriate, and
this also impacts on many cultivators' ability to export even starting materials
at present.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

In addition, should one of those batches fail testing for whatever reason, that's an astronomical loss that no company would be willing to risk. It's completely unnecessary and serves little purpose other than adding additional cost overheads to bring a product to market, and is a time-sink that we're sure that the MCA would rather not deal with. That legislation has inadvertently provided a massive incentive to import product from overseas in tiny batches, or the exploitation of other such loopholes in the legislation whereby the manufacturing / supply license company does not do the cultivation.
